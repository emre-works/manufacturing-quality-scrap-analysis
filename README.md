# Manufacturing Quality & Scrap Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes manufacturing quality performance with a focus on scrap rate trends, production lines, shifts, and defect categories.

An interactive Tableau dashboard is used to visualize key metrics and identify areas for quality improvement.

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public
- Manufacturing quality data (synthetic / anonymized)

## Dashboard
Interactive dashboard available on Tableau Public:

## Key Insights
- Line 4 shows the highest scrap rate across production lines.
- Fabric defects are the main driver of quality losses.
- The dashboard supports filtering by line and shift for deeper analysis.

## Next Steps
- Automate monthly quality reporting
- Integrate AI-generated insight summaries
- Build an end-to-end reporting workflow
