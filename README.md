# Manufacturing Quality & Scrap Analysis – Monthly Overview

## Project Overview
This project analyzes monthly manufacturing quality performance using production and defect data from January 2023.

The goal is to identify high scrap areas, understand defect drivers, and support data-driven quality improvement decisions.

An interactive Tableau dashboard is used to visualize key metrics and trends.

## Business Context
Manufacturing quality teams need clear visibility into scrap rates by production line, shift, and defect category to prioritize improvement actions.

This project simulates a real-world quality reporting scenario commonly used in manufacturing environments.

## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau Public (dashboard visualization)
- Python (exploratory analysis)
- CSV-based manufacturing quality data

## Tableau Dashboard

## Key Insights
- Line 4 shows the highest scrap rate among all production lines.
- Fabric-related defects are the primary contributor to quality losses.
- Scrap rates are similar across Day and Night shifts.
- Line 4 is identified as a priority area for quality improvement.
